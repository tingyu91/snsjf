# MEAN Stack Starter Kit

snsjf_app is an open-source boilerplate solution based on the MEAN stack and provides a solid starting point for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [Angular](https://angular.io/) based applications. This project includes modern tools and workflow based on [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), best practices from the community, a scalable base template and a good learning base.

### Benefits

- Quickstart a project in seconds and focus on features, not on frameworks or tools

- Industrial-grade tools, ready for usage in a continuous integration environment and DevOps

- Scalable architecture with base app template including example components, services and tests

- Module based development for both client and server

## Before You Begin
Before you begin, it's recommend you read about the basic building blocks that assemble a MEAN stack application:
* MongoDB - Go through [MongoDB Official Website](https://www.mongodb.com/) and proceed to their [Official Manual](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/), which should help you understand NoSQL and MongoDB better.
* Express - The best way to understand express is through its [Official Website](http://expressjs.com/), which has a [Getting Started](http://expressjs.com/starter/installing.html) guide, as well as an [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) guide for general express topics. You can also go through this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8144214/learning-express-for-node-js) for more resources.
* Angular - Angular's [Official Website](https://angular.io/) is a great starting point.
* Node.js - Start by going through [Node.js Official Website](http://nodejs.org/) and this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353818/how-do-i-get-started-with-node-js), which should get you going with the Node.js platform in no time.

Checkout our blog [Techievor](https://techievor.com) built on snsjf_app for a full rundown on how to setup the MEAN stack with snsjf_app:
* [Windows](https://techievor.com/blog/post/2019/02/28/how-to-install-the-mean-stack-on-windows)
* [CentOS](https://techievor.com/blog/post/2019/03/03/how-to-install-the-mean-stack-on-centos)

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.  This version of snsjf_app requires at minimum version >=14.0.0 of Node.js, v14.15.0 being the recommended.
* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017). This version of snsjf_app requires at minimum version >=4.2, v4.2.15 being the recommended.

# Getting Started

1. Go to project folder and create a .env file to setup your environment
```
NODE_ENV='development'
PRODUCTION=
HTTP_PROXY=

MONGO_SEED_LOG_RESULTS=true

GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=''
GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL=''
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY=""
GOOGLE_VIEW_ID=
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=''
RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=''

MAILER_FROM='support@snsjf_app.com'
MAILER_SERVICE_PROVIDER=
MAILER_HOST='smtp.ethereal.email'
MAILER_PORT=587
MAILER_USER='username'
MAILER_SECRET='pass'
MAILER_TEST=true
```

2. Setup link-package:
```bash
npm run init
```
 This command will setup git hooks and preemptively bundle all package.json files located under the modules directory.

3. Next install dependencies:
 ```bash
 npm install
 ```

4. Run the MongoDB Seed (Optional)
To have the default menu feature(s), role(s), and/or user account(s) at runtime:
```bash
npm run seed
```
This will try to seed the features, roles, and users based on the defined NODE_ENV in your env config. You have to copy the user passwords from the console and store it somewhere safe.

5. Running with TLS (Optional)
The application will start by default with the secuire configuration (SSL mode) turned off and listen on port 3000.  To run your application in a secure manner, you'll need to use OpenSSL and generate a set of self-signed certificates.  Unix-based users can use the following command:
```bash
npm run generate-ssl-certs
```
Windows users can follow the instructions found [here](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX128656).  After you've generated the key and certificate, ensure they are placed in the config/sslcerts folder.

6. Then launch development server, and open `localhost:4200` in your browser:
 ```bash
 npm run start:dev
 ```

# Running in Production

To run snsjf_app with production environment settings, you must set the following env variables:
```
NODE_ENV='production'
PRODUCTION=true
```

To enable/disable SSL mode in a production environment, set the HOST_SECURE variable in your env config.

Explore config/env/production.js for additional production environment configuration options.

# Main Tasks

Task automation is based on [NPM scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts).

Tasks                         | Description
------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

npm run start:prod            | Builds client for prod and runs production express server
npm run test:client           | Lint code and run unit tests once for continuous integration
npm run lint:client           | Lint client code

npm run e2e                   | Run e2e tests using [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org)
npm run generate-ssl-certs    | Generates self-signed certificates on Unix-based systems using OpenSSL
npm run seed                  | Seeds the database with defaults based on defined configuration

## Link Packages
The follow parameters are used with link:install & link:uninstall
```
parms:                     
  |--pkg={name of npm package} 
  |--type={type of dependency: blank or dependencies; dev or devDependencies} 
  |--mod={target mod; can leave blank for core}
```

## Development Server

Run `npm run start:dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change
any of the source files.
You should not use `ng serve` directly, as it does not use the backend express configuration.

## Code Scaffolding

Run `npm run generate -- component <name>` to generate a new component. You can also use
`npm run generate -- directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

If you have installed [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) globally with `npm install -g @angular/cli`,
you can also use the command `ng generate` directly.

## Running Unit Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running End-to-End Tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further Help

Tasks are mostly based on the `angular-cli` tool. Use `ng help` to get more help or go check out the
[Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

# What's In The Box

The app template is based on [HTML5](http://whatwg.org/html), [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org) and
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com).
